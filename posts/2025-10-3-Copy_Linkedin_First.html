    <h1>Starting my “Blog Posts”</h1>

    <h2>Hello everyone!</h2>

    <p>It’s been a while since I last posted here, but that’s about to change.</p>

    <p>Classes started back up about a month ago, and after Expo I realized that while I spend a lot of time working on engineering projects outside of class, almost no one in my professional world gets to see them unless I share. Right now, my LinkedIn doesn’t really reflect the work I’m most proud of — and I want to change that.</p>

    <p>So, I’m starting a weekly blog here on LinkedIn (and hopefully on my website soon). Each week, I’ll share:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A summary of interesting projects I’ve worked on in the last week</li>
      <li>Anything currently in-progress that I hope to update more on in the future</li>
      <li>A short analysis of a tech update that caught my attention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Part of this is to push myself to stay on top of current events, but it’s also about improving my communication skills and opening up my projects to a wider audience. If I’m accountable to all of you instead of just myself, I believe even more exciting things can get done.</p>

    <p class="footer">Stay tuned to see my first post — I’m excited to hear your thoughts!</p>
